                        <li>Monopoly is designed for 2-8 players. The goal of the game is to bankrupt your opponents by buying property, building houses, and charging rent.</li>
                        <li>Select one player to be the banker. The banker hands out deeds, makes change, and distributes money to other players.</li>
                        <li>When you land on unpurchased properties, you can purchase them. If you can’t purchase it (or don’t want to), it is auctioned off to other players.</li>
                        <li>Gameplay ends when only one player remains.</li>
